## What ss This?
This was simply a fun little script I was putting together based on an idea I had to randomly select a game to play. Originally it was written in batch and much simpler but I wanted to work on learning some more on PowerShell by creating a simple GUI with it. I also wanted to expand the script beyond just having it written manually inside the script itself so I'm working on getting it to create files to read the data from and make it possible to edit it from within the GUI. 

## Does it Work?
Not at the moment.
